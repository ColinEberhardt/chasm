## A very simple compile-to-WebAssembly language

You can [play with chasm online](https://colineberhardt.github.io/chasm/).

chasm is a very simple programming language which I have developed to accompany a talk at [FullStack Conference NYC](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/11077-fullstack-nyc-2019-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things). It is not intended to be a fully featured language; rather, its purpose is two-fold:

1. Introduce the basic building blocks of compilers - and show that they aren't that scary or difficult!
2. Reveal some of the inner working of WebAssembly, a new and exciting language / runtime that I think people need to know more about.

The commits in this repo correspond to the live demos in the accompanying talk, if you'd like to follow along at home!
